# Graphe Plateforme

A Streamlit-based interactive platform for visualizing and understanding Graph Algorithms like:

- Dijkstra (Shortest Path)
- Bellman-Ford (Handling negative weights)
- Prim (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- Kruskal (Minimum Spanning Tree)

Built for educational & practical purposes, this platform helps users interact with graphs and observe the execution of algorithms step-by-step.
